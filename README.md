# EGBEMU
This is an Excel GameBoy emulator in Visual Basic

Tetris is completely working. With a nowadays computer (i5, 8GB RAM) almost 60 fps can be achieved.

Some remarks in Spanish (sorry ;-P). Moreover, my Excel is in Spanish so some excel functions can have Spanish names and it cannot work in English Excel version. Some error can be fixed just changing the Spanish function name for the English function name (look for that names in the Internet). Besides, Excel 2013 version is used to develope it. I don't know if this code works with other version.

You have to create an excel sheet with one or two pixels columns and rows in order to recreate the GB screen. Put path from your tetris rom in "loadROM" sub.

Thanks and enjoy!!!
